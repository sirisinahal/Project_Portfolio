    <h1 class="w3-center">Taxonomy of Building Skills</h1><br>
    <p class="w3-large">At first, I thought that creating a Skills Taxonomy was a simple process that could be accomplished simply by organising skills in a hierarchical manner. However, through my follow - up time experience, I've realised the importance of creating a thorough Skills Taxonomy and the time and effort that goes into building it.</p>
    <p class="w3-large">Scraping data from websites, studying Skills Taxonomies from various websites, normalising and cleaning the data, studying and applying appropriate algorithms to data to obtain the skills in the required format, working on improving the accuracy of algorithms, and so on are all steps involved in the creation of a Skills Taxonomy. Slight oversight in Skills Substantially reduces the platform's value.</p>

To trigger desired events, Selenium employs a web-driver package that may take control of the browser and simulate user-oriented activities.</p>

        <h1 class="w3-center">Analysis of the O*NET website</h1><br>
        <p class="w3-large">The O*NET database contains a large number of variables that represent job and worker characteristics, such as skill needs. The professions are defined by the O*NET-SOC taxonomy, and the Content Model specifies which information is gathered. With data from the working public, the Data Collection programme brings these frameworks to life.</p>

        <br>
          <p class="w3-large">Sprint 2 provided an excellent gaming experience. In this case, we had to research the O*NET website and design an uniform schema for the Skills Taxonomy. The website included substantial data in the form of 38 files, for which we discovered the linkage and constructed a schema using Python utilities (Pandas, Numpy).At first, analysing the data on the website caused confusion; however, after much effort, we were able to link the data threads. Finally, we gathered 45K skills from the website (technical and non-technical).</p>

          <p class="w3-large">These services were chosen because they are highly scalable, durable, safe and secure, and easy to manage clusters.
            Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service that allows you to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers may construct APIs that interact with AWS or other online services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. </p>
          <p class="w3-large">AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service that runs code in response to events and maintains the underlying computing resources autonomously.
            Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is online storage. Amazon S3 may be used to store and retrieve any quantity of data from anywhere on the internet at any time.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">In Sprint 3, I delved into AWS services, investigating API Gateway, Lambda, and S3. Furthermore, I uploaded the files to an S3 bucket, wrote code to create API calls for both skills and job titles using the POST method, and granted permission to internal teams to use these API calls to extract the appropriate data using API Gateway. Analyzed and updated the code to meet the needs of all error codes issued while accessing API requests using the POSTMAN tool.

      <p class="w3-large">The BERT algorithm was chosen since it was created by Google and is the most profitable NLP model available for context matching. </p>
      <p class="w3-large">The FuzzyWuzzy technique is mostly used for string matching, we utilised it to match job titles.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">I studied several String matching algorithms and NLP models for matching Job titles and competencies for Sprint 4. Later in my research, I discovered that the BERT and FuzzyWuzzy algorithms were the greatest fit for my needs.I ran both the BERT and FuzzyWuzzy algorithms on a sample data set of around 2000 job titles and skills, manually compared the results, and calculated accuracy using a confusion matrix, and the results led us to the conclusion that the data needed to be cleaned and normalised to improve the algorithm's accuracy.</p>

        <p class="w3-large">I focused on boosting the algorithm's accuracy for Sprint 5. For this, I used the BERT algorithm on a sample data set of about 1000 job titles, before and after cleaning the data, and personally reviewed the results, calculating accuracy, precision, and frequency using the confusion matrix. These findings lead us to conclude that the True positives and False positives data for the manually cleaned and uncleaned data had changed. Cleaning the data manually  and identifying patterns to eliminate irrelevant data is a time-consuming process.
